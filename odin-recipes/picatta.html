    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chicken Piccata is a classic Italian-American dish consisting of pan-fried chicken cutlets coated in a tangy lemon-butter-caper sauce. 
        The chicken is typically dredged in flour, browned, and then finished in a sauce made with lemon juice, butter, and capers. It's known 
        for its bright, citrusy flavor and is often served with pasta or rice to soak up the delicious sauce.
